# Zindi-Tanzania-Tourism-Prediction
Good day. 

This is a fun project I found on Zindi Competitions. The goal of this project is to predict the amount going to be spent by a tourist when they visit Tanzania. For this project 
I will be using regression algorithms to predict the total amount going to be spent. The whole project will be split into 3 notebook files. First one for Data cleaning
second one for Exploratory data analysis,feature extraction and engineering and third one will be for the models. If you need more information about the project I have 
attached a link below.
